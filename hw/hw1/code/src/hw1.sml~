(*  **********
*   PROBLEM 1
*
*a)int, "7" is an int, and so the operation x*7 can only return an int.
*b)real, "7.0" is a real, and so the operation x*7.0 can only return a real.
*c)int or real, ~ and * work for both.
*d)real, .sin() and / are both for reals
*e)cannot be assigned, .sin() is for reals and div is for ints

  *   PROBLEM 2

  (*  round10(x) = y, where y is the result of rounding x to the nearest 10-th.
  *
  *   Real.round(0.5) = 0?  Yes; see API docs.

    0.0

  (*  **********
  *   PROBLEM 3.
  *)

  (*  rotate1 [x_0,...,x_{n-1}] = [x_1,...,x_{n-1},x_0].
  *)
  fun rotate1 (xs : int list) : int list =
    []

  (*  rotate ([x_0,...,x_{m-1}], n) = [x_n,...,x_{m-1},x_0,...,x_{n-1}].
  *)
  fun rotate (xs : int list, n : int) : int list =
    []

  (*  **********
  *   PROBLEM 4.
  *)

  (*  editDist (u, v) = the edit distance from u to v, as defined in
  *   the assignment.
  *)
  fun editDist(u : string, v : string) : int =
    0
